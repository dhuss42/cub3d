
MAP:
valid characters: 1, 0, N, E, S, W

map open
tabs or invalid characters
more than one player
no player
no map

TEXTURES: (NO, WE, SO, EA)
missing
not in one line
duplicate (?)
non valid files -> after parsing
are directory -> after parsing

COLORS: (F, C)
missing
duplicate (?)
invalid characters instead of rgb numbers
negative numbers
numbers >255 (?)
missing number (255,0,)
too many numbers
not in one line

GENERAL:
elements in the same line
map not at the end of file / word after map
sensless content (?)
filename not ending on .cub
empty file

PLAN:
DONE 0. check if filename ending on .cub
DONE 1. Search for NO, WE, SO, EA, F and C, jump whitespaces and read following letters
	check for duplicate
DONE 2. files: ->read filename until whitespace or newline
	if somthing after it, error
3. DONE colors: ->read number until ','.
	DONE Transform to int
	DONE Check if valid number.
	DONE Do this until we have 3 numbers
	DONE error if != 3 numbers
	DONE if after 3. number is something, error
	DONE Transform it to uint32_t (0xFF0000)
4. DONE map: before: skip any newlines
	set flag for beginning map (when colors and textures exist)
	count lines with getnext line. Remember line where map begins
	for writing into map, do another round of getnextline.
	DONE read until eof and safe map in **map

after reading:
1. DONE check if everything present (NO, WE, SO, EA, F, C , map)
2. DONE files: check if files of textures valid (just do fd = open(file, O_RDONLY) ?)
3. DONE check if map is there / in right position
4. DONE map: check if any unvalid characters (also newline without other content?) (this includes also characters after map end)
	DONE check if player == 1
	DONE floodfill from player position to check if map is closed
5. DONE(?) Check if any nonsense between lines

TODO:
DONE check if "file" is directory
NOPE better test for missing texture or color
DONE delete newlines after map or throw error?
DONE CHeck for memory leaks (system leaks not working :Â´( 	)
clean norm errors in parser
improve Makefile
	-> add download MLX library?
	-> make one for leak checking?
research how to add music?
